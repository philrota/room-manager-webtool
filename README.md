## Hotel room manager web tool

this Tool finds useful for a small hotel to manage its rooms.
The user can Insert,Search one or get the entire list of the rooms written on the database.
The db is stanced on firebase,and the backend can be found in the hrm-functions repo,consisted in cloud functions to execute requests.

### Why?
This project was developed for learning apis and database mechanism,so it needs some improvements that will be committed in the next commits.

### What i learnt
i learnt how to build a stable backend with node.js and express.
i learnt how to fetch apis,retrieve data and render it on the frontend with react.js.
i learnt how to handle POST,GET,DELETE requests.

###what would be the next steps?
In the next commits i will add a modify component which can edit an existing element in the database.
Also a delete form would be added, to delete the selected room trough the specific number.
